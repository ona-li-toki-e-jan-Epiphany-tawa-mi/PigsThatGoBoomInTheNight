# PigsThatGoBoomInTheNight

A data pack for Minecraft 1.19.X (but will probably work with 1.13+) that allows you to "feed" TNT to pigs (by dropping TNT items onto them) to make them explosive!

Upon taking damage of any kind they will instantly explode.

## Installation

Grab a version from [RELEASES](https://github.com/ona-li-toki-e-jan-Epiphany-tawa-mi/PigsThatGoBoomInTheNight/releases "PigsThatGoBoomInTheNight Releases Page") and place it inside your world's datapacks folder. [See for more information.](https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack "A Minecraft Wiki tutorial on installing data packs")

The pack will automatically finish installation on world load, but you can force it using:

```text
/function pgsthtgbmnthnght:try_install
```

## Uninstallation

To uninstall, you first need to run this command:

```text
/function pgsthtgbmnthnght:uninstall
```

After that, remove the datapack from your world's datapacks folder before reloading.
